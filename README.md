## Session Agenda:

1. What Is Simplicity
2. Fedimint + Simplicity (aka Simpimint)
3. Rollups + Simplicity
4. Elements + Simplicity
5. Conclusion

## What's In This Repl?

Nothing less than the best resource on Simplicity on the web!

- Section 1 is this page
- Sections 2-5 cover the slides of the talk
- Sections 6-8 explain some of the foundations of Simplicity in detail
- Section 9 contains links and summaries of past talks
- Section 10 contains links and summaries of past blog posts

## Hackathon Ideas Chris Could Help You With:

1. Execute Simplicity transactions on Elements Core (regtest). There is a [`simplicity` branch for Elements](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/tree/simplicity) that accepts Simplicity programs inside specially tagged tap leaves. The tool [tappy](https://github.com/uncomputable/tappy/tree/simplicity) lets you write Simplicity transactions using Miniscript-esque descriptors. Feel free to experiment!
2. Add a Simplicity contract into the Fedimint Lightning module. Subject of the talk. This is a continuation of the Simpimint project from  last year (which won first prize at the hackerthon btw).
3. Build interesting Simplicity programs using [rust-simplicity](https://github.com/ElementsProject/rust-simplicity). Last year I built a [program that verifies the computation of a Turing machine](https://github.com/uncomputable/simple-turing). There are infinitely many other options. Anything is possible with Simplicity.
