## 2019-10-15 CES Summit

[Transcript](https://btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/2019-10-15-russell-oconnor-simplicity/)

In this talk from October 2019, Russell O'Connor discusses Simplicity, a new programming language designed to make smart contracts on blockchain platforms more secure and easier to develop. He argues that current smart contract programming languages are complex and error-prone, leading to hacks and lost funds. Simplicity, on the other hand, is a low-level language with a formal specification that can be mathematically verified, making it less susceptible to bugs and vulnerabilities. O'Connor also discusses the advantages of using Simplicity over other smart contract programming languages, as well as some potential use cases for the language.

## 2018-01-29 Simplicity

[Transcript](https://btctranscripts.com/blockchain-protocol-analysis-security-engineering/2018/2018-01-25-russell-oconnor-simplicity/)

In this talk, Russell O'Connor discusses the Simplicity programming language, which is designed for creating and executing smart contracts on the blockchain. He explains that Simplicity is a minimalist language that focuses on security, and it achieves this by limiting the number of language constructs and using a formal verification method to ensure the correctness of the code. O'Connor also provides examples of how Simplicity can be used to create various types of smart contracts, including multi-party protocols and digital signatures. Overall, the talk emphasizes the importance of security in blockchain programming and highlights the potential of Simplicity as a tool for achieving this goal.
